// A residential neighborhood has n houses, numbered from 0 to n - 1, and n is at least 2.

// one will travel from House 2 to House 4, and then from House 4 to House 1.
// A route must have at least two house numbers (i.e. length of at least 2),
// and consecutive pair of houses in the route are not allowed to be the same house.

// The distance of a route is the sum of the distances between 
// every consecutive pair of houses in the route. The distance from House i to House j
// can be found at the element mat[i][j] of a distance matrix mat, which is represented as a n-by-n 2D array.

// Note that mat[i][j] can be different from mat[j][i] for i â‰  j, and they are all positive.
// Also, mat[i][i] is zero for all i = 0 ... n-1.
